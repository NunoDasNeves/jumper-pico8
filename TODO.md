### Platforming
- Foot collision - its just 1 point rn
- Wall bounce - less, or allow sliding on walls
- Tune acceleration
    - instant decel on ground?
    - slow decel in air (momentum from ground speed)
    - air control
#### Maybe
- Wall jump? Slide down? Climb?
- Fireball propels you opposite direction

### Game flow
- Lanterns
- Screen transition, level layout

### Enemies
